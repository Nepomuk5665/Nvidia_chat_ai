Fine-tuning GPT-Neo on Custom Dataset
This project involves fine-tuning the GPT-Neo model on a custom dataset using the Hugging Face Transformers library.

Requirements
Python 3.6 or later
PyTorch 1.8.0 or later
Transformers 4.5.0 or later
You can install the required packages using pip:

pip install torch transformers

Dataset
The dataset should be a text file with one sample per line. The path to this file is specified in the file_path variable in the script.

Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
Navigate to the cloned repository:
cd yourrepository
Run the script:
python train.py
The script will load the dataset, tokenize it, and fine-tune the GPT-Neo model on it. The trained model and tokenizer will be saved in the directory specified by the model_dir variable.

Output
The trained model and tokenizer are saved in the directory specified by the model_dir variable. You can use these for generating text or further fine-tuning.

Please replace https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git and yourrepository with the actual URL of your repository and its name.
